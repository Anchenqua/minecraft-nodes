## Nodes
tl;dr map painting in block game

1. Map segmented into pre-created **territories** which are groups of contiguous minecraft chunks.
2. Territories have different **resource nodes** which provide different resource yields from mining and different rates for farming, animal breeding, etc...
3. Players form a **town** which controls territories. Initial territory claims must be connected.
4. **War** is capturing territories from another town.
5. Towns choose 1 territory to be their capital which cannot be taken until all other territories are captured.
6. A captured territory is **occupied** and provides resource benefits to the occupier. The occupier has the option to **annex** a territory and add it to their town.
